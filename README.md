# Awesome Testers

Awesome testers is a community project that lifts up awesome testers paying particular 
attention to women and non-binary people. It often feels the de-facto in the world is still 
recognizing excellence in men, but at same time increasingly women recognizing excellence in 
non-men. The circles we keep bias what we value. For this project, we're making it acceptable 
to have a recognized bias towards bringing forth what we don't see without extra effort. 

We aim at doing two things with this:

   * Name an awesome tester a day, where gender is not the point, awesomeness is
   * Quote an awesome tester a week, where gender is not the point, awesomeness is
   
We recognize the forces that place non-men as the inspiration (with no particular content) or 
as foundation (enabling and promoting other people's content). We seek to share here people's 
contributions to the field of software testing and quality. 

# More Detail

   * We add people to the site on batches, and promote their addition on a pace of one a day
   * Once a week we recognize a particularly impactful awesome tester whose impact through keynotes, 
   talks and articles is significant
   * 3 times a week we refresh our known awesome tester's descriptions from existing list
   * 3 times a week we find new awesome testers we missed on previous rounds
   * Once a week we seek to find an awesome tester's quote worth remembering and put that into our instagram 
   that we later integrate to these pages

Your help in the project is welcome. Use 
<a href="https://github.com/AwesomeTesters/awesometesters-site/issues">github issues</a> or PRs to 
this repo to submit quotes and/or nominations of women and non-binary people contributing to software testing
and quality.

# Other Ideas around the theme

   * Writing articles of awesome testers to reputable magazines
   * Writing a book about awesome testers
   * Organizing an awesome testers conference where all speakers are from the list to 
   allow audiences a chance of hearing them
