<h1> Awesome Testers You Should Keep Your Eye on Always </h1>
<p>
    In <a href="https://agiletestingdays.com/blog/125-awesome-testers-you-should-keep-your-eye-on-always/">2017</a>
    - <a href="https://agiletestingdays.com/blog/next-125-awesome-testers-you-should-keep-your-eye-on-always/">2018</a>,
    a working party within WiT community collected together two lists of
    awesome testers. A third list was created independently with focus on awesome testers of South America.
    This website draws on and continues that work. More awesome testers are discovered every day.
</p>
<p>
    Tester awesomeness is global, and we are just getting started on recognizing it. This
    list is a celebration of awesome testers that lead the way into the future of our
    industry and you should definitely keep your eye on!
</p>
<p>
    As always, lists are not comprehensive, but we put our best effort into making this list
    of the awesome people we look up to & learn from and expect that you can find nuggets of
    wisdom following their work. Welcome to Awesome Testers You Should Keep Your Eye on Always!
</p>
<p>
    <i>* Note: As lists always do, this represents the limited view of its authors. There are more
    amazing testers that either we forgot at time of making this list or have not yet had the
    pleasure of realizing they exist. The hard prioritization for a growing list has been made with
    the criteria of really brilliant, impactful people that first came to mind that deserve
        to be on this list of awesome testers.</i>

    Maaret is a tester, a polyglot programmer, speaker, author, sponsor and mentor of
    new voices in conferences. She has been awarded Most Influential Software Testing
    Professional Person (MIATPP) 2016 and Eurostar Testing Excellence Award 2020,
    and selected on list on 100 most influential in IT in Finland 2019.
    Her work at Vaisala as principal test engineer includes hands-on testing as well as
    growing testing capabilities. She created and run European Testing Conference for 5 years,
    until deciding to focus on content creation and retired the conference. She remixed
    Mob Programming to create Ensemble Testing, a powerful group exploratory technique.
    She shares the credit of renaming Mob Programming to Ensemble Programming with Denise Yu,
    and the change in terminology would not have started without them both.
    <br> She is a tester active sharing her experiences on both twitter and her blog and her books,
    and volunteers on helping new speakers get started with TechVoices.
